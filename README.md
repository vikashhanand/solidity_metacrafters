# KINSHU Token
# MyToken Smart Contract

## Project Title
MyToken Smart Contract

## Simple Overview
A basic Ethereum smart contract for a token named "VIKASHANAND" (symbol: "KINSHU"), allowing for minting and burning of tokens while tracking balances.

## Description
The `MyToken` smart contract provides a simple implementation of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. Each token balance is tracked through a mapping, enabling easy management of token supplies and balances. The contract can be deployed on any Ethereum network, facilitating straightforward token management.

## Getting Started

### Installing

#### How/Where to Download
1. Clone the repository or copy the smart contract code into your Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix).

#### Modifications Needed
No modifications are needed for basic functionality. Customize the token name, symbol, and initial supply if required.

### Executing Program

#### How to Run the Program
1. **Open Remix or your preferred Solidity IDE.**
2. **Create a new file and paste the smart contract code.**
3. **Compile the contract using Solidity version 0.8.26.**
4. **Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Rinkeby testnet, or a local blockchain like Ganache).**

#### Step-by-Step Commands
```solidity
// Mint 1000 tokens to address 0x123...
myToken.mint(0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678, 1000);

// Burn 500 tokens from address 0x123...
myToken.burn(0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678, 500);
```

## Help

### Common Issues
- **Insufficient Balance for Burning:** Ensure the address has enough tokens before calling `burn`.
- **Contract Deployment Issues:** Check the Solidity version and network configuration.

#### Command for Help
If your program contains helper info, you can add a command to access it. Otherwise, refer to Solidity documentation and forums for assistance.
